# Frequency-Analysis

Simple version of frequency analysis to potentially decipher encrypted messages by counting the occurences of letters in a ciphertext and matching them to the most common letters to reveal the original message.

Current version requires manual corrections one by one from user, but code could be improved to require less manual input from user.
